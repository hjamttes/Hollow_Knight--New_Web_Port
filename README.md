The diff. between the optimized and non optimized is mainly visuals. If your chromebook or other device can't handle the normal version well, use the optimized version. The only caveat is that the optimized version won't look as sharp. It still looks good, though. The reason the optimized doesn't look as sharp is because it is now 480p instead of 1080p, so the game runs in 480p instead of your monitor's resolution for less load on the GPU. To change it to 720p, replace the existing resolution code with the following:
canvas.width = 1280;
canvas.height = 720;
